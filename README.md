# HashFileSearch

First iteration of Hash Search acting as proof of concept of faster file search speed using hashed bigrams. The initial iteration intended only as a quick implementation of the idea. As time progresses, the files and code will be more organized.

The temp folder holds the texts to search (i.e. the "file system" that is being searched). Currently, there are two .dat files that can be run. The most useful is BigramDictionary2.dat. It is the serialized bigram hash table of approx 3.2 GB of English text (or 73 additional copies of the "Long Texts" folder in the "temp" folder). All files were not included due to reasonable GitHub size constraints.

Changes on this project to come.
